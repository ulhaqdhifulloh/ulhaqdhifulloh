## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Dhifulloh Dhiya Ulhaq**, an undergraduate student currently pursuing a degree in **Information Systems** at **Telkom University**, Bandung. I am deeply passionate about **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**, and I enjoy exploring how AI can transform the world around us.

I have completed several certifications in **Machine Learning** and am now actively applying what I've learned through real-world projects and case studies. This GitHub account serves as a repository for my learning journey, projects, and collaborations in the field of AI and beyond.

My current focus is on applying AI and Machine Learning techniques to solve real-world problems. I'm open to collaboration and always eager to learn from others in the field. Feel free to explore my repositories, and let's connect if you're interested in collaborating on any AI-related projects!
