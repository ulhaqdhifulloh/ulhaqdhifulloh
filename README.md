## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Dhifulloh Dhiya Ulhaq**, an undergraduate student currently pursuing a degree in **Information Systems** at **Telkom University**, Bandung. I am deeply passionate about **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**, and I enjoy exploring how AI can transform the world around us.

I have completed several certifications in **Machine Learning** and am now actively applying what I've learned through real-world projects and case studies. This GitHub account serves as a repository for my learning journey, projects, and collaborations in the field of AI and beyond.
